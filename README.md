<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Stuck with complex to-do lists and daily task managers? 

**EisenList** is a minimal Eisenhower Matrix, made to GET-SHIT-DONE (only).

Use this tool to accelarate your day-planning routine and make your daily calender with quickly.

EisenList runs completely offline in your browser. No need to worry about privacy or internet outages. You data never leaves your browser.

This app took shape when I was unable to find a good implementation of Eisenhower Matrix online and decided to make one for myself.

Here are some resources that might help you make best use of this webapp:
* [Use calendars. Not to-do lists.](https://blog.usejournal.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd) [ Article on how to plan your day ]
* [How to use Eisenhower Boxes and be productive](https://jamesclear.com/eisenhower-box)

... will update this list periodically

Of course, no software is perfect. Let me know your suggestions and feature requests here. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
